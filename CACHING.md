# Caching Implementation

## Overview

The Frenzy movie app now implements a comprehensive in-memory caching system to improve performance, reduce API calls, and enhance user experience.

## Benefits

### 1. **Faster Load Times**
- Cached data loads instantly without waiting for API responses
- Subsequent visits to the same movie or search results are near-instantaneous

### 2. **Reduced API Calls**
- Minimizes requests to the OMDB API
- Helps stay within API rate limits
- Reduces bandwidth usage

### 3. **Better User Experience**
- Smoother navigation between pages
- No loading delays when revisiting cached content
- Improved responsiveness during browsing

### 4. **Cost Efficiency**
- Fewer API calls mean lower costs if using a paid API tier
- Reduced server load

## Cache Strategy

### Cache Durations

Different types of data have different cache durations based on how frequently they change:

| Data Type | Duration | Reason |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Search Results** | 5 minutes | Search results can change as new content is added |
| **Movie Details** | 30 minutes | Movie information is relatively static |
| **Autocomplete** | 2 minutes | Quick searches benefit from short-term caching |

### Cache Keys

Cache keys are generated based on:
- Endpoint type (search, details, autocomplete)
- Query parameters (sorted alphabetically for consistency)

Example cache keys:
```
search?page=1&s=batman
details?i=tt0372784
autocomplete?s=bat
```

## Implementation Details

### Core Functions

#### `getCacheKey(endpoint, params)`
Generates a unique cache key from endpoint and parameters.

#### `getCachedData(key)`
Retrieves cached data if it exists and hasn't expired.

#### `setCachedData(key, data, duration)`
Stores data in cache with timestamp and expiration duration.

### Automatic Cleanup

The cache automatically cleans up expired entries every 60 seconds to prevent memory bloat.

### API Functions with Caching

All three main API functions now support caching:

1. **`searchMovies()`** - Caches search results for 5 minutes
2. **`getMovieDetails()`** - Caches movie details for 30 minutes
3. **`getAutocompleteSuggestions()`** - Caches suggestions for 2 minutes

## Cache Management

### Visual Indicator

A cache indicator appears in the bottom-right corner showing:
- Number of cached items
- List of cached entries
- Clear cache button

### Manual Cache Control

```javascript
import { clearCache, getCacheStats } from './services/movieService';

// Clear all cached data
clearCache();

// Get cache statistics
const stats = getCacheStats();
console.log(`Cache size: ${stats.size}`);
```

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Improvements

- **First visit**: Same speed (data must be fetched)
- **Cached visit**: ~100-500ms faster (no network delay)
- **API calls**: Reduced by 60-80% for typical usage patterns

### Cache Hit Scenarios

You'll see cache hits when:
- Revisiting a movie detail page within 30 minutes
- Performing the same search within 5 minutes
- Typing the same autocomplete query within 2 minutes
- Navigating back to previous search results

## Best Practices

### When to Clear Cache

Clear the cache when:
- Testing new features
- Debugging data issues
- After major app updates
- User reports stale data

### Cache Considerations

- Cache is stored in memory (lost on page refresh)
- Cache size grows with usage but is automatically cleaned
- Only successful API responses are cached (except autocomplete)
- Cache is transparent to users

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the caching system:

1. **LocalStorage Persistence**
   - Persist cache across page refreshes
   - Implement cache versioning

2. **Smart Prefetching**
   - Prefetch likely next pages
   - Preload popular movies

3. **Cache Size Limits**
   - Implement LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction
   - Set maximum cache size

4. **User Preferences**
   - Allow users to configure cache duration
   - Toggle caching on/off

5. **Analytics**
   - Track cache hit rates
   - Monitor performance improvements

## Console Logging

Cache hits are logged to the console for debugging:

```
Cache hit for search: batman 1
Cache hit for movie details: tt0372784
Cache hit for autocomplete: bat
```

To disable these logs in production, remove or comment out the `console.log` statements in `movieService.js`.

## Technical Notes

- Uses JavaScript `Map` for O(1) lookup performance
- Timestamps stored in milliseconds
- Cache keys are deterministic (same params = same key)
- Thread-safe for single-threaded JavaScript environment
- No external dependencies required

## Troubleshooting

### Cache Not Working

1. Check browser console for cache hit logs
2. Verify cache indicator shows cached items
3. Ensure API responses are successful (Response: 'True')

### Stale Data

1. Clear cache manually using the indicator
2. Reduce cache duration in `CACHE_DURATION` config
3. Check if API data has actually changed

### Memory Concerns

- Cache automatically cleans expired entries
- Manual clear available via UI
- Cache size displayed in indicator
- Consider implementing size limits for production
